#### _Hair Salon App, 5/4/18_

#### By _**Andrew Lupton**_

## Description

_An app for a hair salon, where the owner/user is able to create a list of stylists, and for each stylist, a list of clients._

## Specs

* _The program should allow the user to input a list of stylists through a text input box, and store these entries in a database._
  * _The program should allow for additional entries of stylists, if, for instance, a new stylist were to be hired._

* _The program should allow the user to enter a client or clients for each stylist, and store these entries in a database._
  * _The program should not allow a client to be entered without a corresponding stylist, thus if no stylists have been entered it should be impossible to enter a client._
  * _The program should allow the user to add additional clients to a specific stylist._

* _The program should allow the user to recall entries from the database for both stylists and clients, and be able to access a list of details for each type of entry._

* _The program should allow the user to update existing entries for both stylists and clients._

* _The program should allow the user to delete existing entries for both stylists and clients._
